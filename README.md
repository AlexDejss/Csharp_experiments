# There I want to public my experiments with C#.

Projects: 
  SwapScroll (?!), It should be Sound Scroll:D
  - Using NAudio, I created a program that in any window will scroll down, if it possible (press key "Page Down" in most of cases one time). Wrote it so long ago, follow here a bit ugly code:D
